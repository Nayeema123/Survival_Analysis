> A p-value of 0.038 suggests that there is a statistically significant difference in survival between the high and low expression groups within this cluster.

> The null hypothesis (no difference in survival between groups) is rejected at the 5% significance level.

> This indicates that the expression level of the selected gene (NUP43) significantly affects survival in Cluster 1.

> A p-value of 0.75 indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in survival between the high and low expression groups within this cluster.

> The null hypothesis (no difference in survival between groups) is not rejected.

> This suggests that the expression level of the selected gene (NUP43) does not have a significant impact on survival in Cluster 2.

> A p-value of 0.85 also indicates no statistically significant difference in survival between the high and low expression groups within this cluster.

> The null hypothesis (no difference in survival between groups) is not rejected.

> This suggests that the expression level of the selected gene (NUP43) does not have a significant impact on survival in Cluster 3.


# SUMMARY
> Cluster 1: NUP43 gene significantly impacts survival, with a significant difference in survival between high and low expression groups.

> Clusters 2 and 3: NUP43 gene does not significantly impact survival, as there is no significant difference in survival between high and low expression groups.
