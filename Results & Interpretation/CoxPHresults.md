The Cox Proportional Hazards Model results for NUP43 gene across three clusters have been obtained. Below are the results:

# Cluster 1:
•	Number of Samples (n): 329

•	Number of Events: 39

•	Coefficient (coef): 0.4980

•	Hazard Ratio (exp(coef)): 1.6454

•	P-value: 0.0104


# Interpretation:
•	The hazard ratio of 1.6454 suggests that for every one-unit increase in the expression level of the selected gene, the risk of the event (e.g., death) increases by approximately 64.54%.

•	The p-value of 0.0104 indicates that this relationship is statistically significant.

# Cluster 2:
•	Number of Samples (n): 379

•	Number of Events: 33

•	Coefficient (coef): 0.1720

•	Hazard Ratio (exp(coef)): 1.1877

•	P-value: 0.46

# Interpretation:
•	The hazard ratio of 1.1877 suggests a non-significant increase in risk with higher expression levels.

•	The p-value of 0.46 indicates that this relationship is not statistically significant.

# Cluster 3:
•	Number of Samples (n): 374

•	Number of Events: 79

•	Coefficient (coef): 0.10288

•	Hazard Ratio (exp(coef)): 1.10836

•	P-value: 0.297

# Interpretation:
•	The hazard ratio of 1.10836 suggests a non-significant increase in risk with higher expression levels.

•	The p-value of 0.297 indicates that this relationship is not statistically significant.
